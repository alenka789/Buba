Yeah
I've been catching planes for the fun of it
Then I'll be watching fame turn to punishment
The weather's only sunny when I'm under it
And I haven't really changed, yeah I'm just confident
I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it
A hundred million people couldn't deal with this
I've been tryna grow 'cause people kill for it
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit


Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it
Say she wanna fuck me later
Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it, I'm into it
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit
Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it
I'm getting way too deep
I'm fucking into it
I'm into it, yeah I'm into it
I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm fucking into it

Yeah
I've been catching planes for the fun of it
Then I'll be watching fame turn to punishment
The weather's only sunny when I'm under it
And I haven't really changed, yeah I'm just confident
I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it
A hundred million people couldn't deal with this
I've been tryna grow 'cause people kill for it
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit

Yeah
I've been catching planes for the fun of it
Then I'll be watching fame turn to punishment
The weather's only sunny when I'm under it
And I haven't really changed, yeah I'm just confident
I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it
A hundred million people couldn't deal with this
I've been tryna grow 'cause people kill for it
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit


Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it
Say she wanna fuck me later
Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it, I'm into it
This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit
Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it
I'm getting way too deep
I'm fucking into it
I'm into it, yeah I'm into it
I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm fucking into it



I've been on the road since I was sixteen
They don't really notice I how I see things
These girls they come and go between my bedsheets
And I've been doing blue and causing big scenes, yeah
Pull up and I'm higher than the big trees, yeah
She don't really like it but she needs me, yeah
She saying she don't really miss me
But fuck it, now I'm faded after all things, yeah

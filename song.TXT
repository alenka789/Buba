I've been on the road since I was sixteen
They don't really notice I how I see things
These girls they come and go between my bedsheets
And I've been doing blue and causing big scenes, yeah
Pull up and I'm higher than the big trees, yeah
She don't really like it but she needs me, yeah
She saying she don't really miss me
But fuck it, now I'm faded after all things, yeah
